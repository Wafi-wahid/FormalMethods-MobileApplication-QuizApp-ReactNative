# 📱 Quiz App - Formal Methods in Mobile Applications

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases the application of **Formal Methods (FM)** in mobile app development using **Z-Notation**. The **Quiz App**, developed with **React Native**, integrates FM principles to ensure correctness, security, and reliability. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Mathematical Specification:** Defines system states and transitions using **Z-Notation**.
- **Security & Reliability:** Prevents invalid state changes, ensuring accuracy in quiz operations.
- **Performance Optimization:** Models app behavior for efficient execution.
- **Testing & Verification:** Ensures the app meets its intended design before implementation.

## 📖 What are Formal Methods?
Formal Methods are **mathematical techniques** used to specify, design, and verify software systems for **correctness, reliability, and security**. In mobile applications, FM helps:
- **Define precise app behavior** before coding.
- **Verify algorithms** to prevent hidden defects and biases.
- **Ensure compliance** with security standards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React Native** - Mobile app development framework.
- **Z-Notation** - Formal specification language.
- **Z/Eves** - Tool for verification of formal models.

## 🎯 Implementation

### 🏗️ Using FM in Mobile App Development
Key areas of application:
- **Security:** Defines access control policies.
- **Concurrency:** Models multi-threaded interactions.
- **Performance:** Optimizes resource consumption.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and prevents edge cases.

### 📌 Choosing a Formal Method: Z-Notation
- **Why Z-Notation?**
  - A mathematical specification language.
  - Defines system properties rigorously before implementation.
  - Helps with formal verification and refinement.

### 🔢 Example (Z-Notation for Scoring)
```z
SCORES: ℕ → ℕ
∀ u: ℕ • SCORES u ≥ 0
```
This ensures that **no user's score can be negative**.

### ✅ Functional Specification (Answering a Question)
```z
Answer_Correct? : ℕ × ℕ → BOOL
∀ u, q: ℕ • (Answer_Correct?(u, q) = TRUE ⇒ SCORES' u = SCORES u + 1)
```
Ensures that if an answer is correct, the user’s score **increases by 1**.

### 🔍 Verification Phase
We use **Z/Eves** to prove correctness by:
- Checking **invariant preservation** (e.g., scores never go negative).
- Validating **state transitions** (e.g., ensuring users progress through quiz questions correctly).

## 📚 Real-World Applications of FM
### 🔹 **E-commerce App**
- FM ensures **secure and reliable payment processing**.
- Formal verification of **transaction statuses** (pending, successful, failed).

### 🔹 **Healthcare Appointment Scheduling App**
- Uses **Z-Notation + VDM** to define **doctor-patient schedules**.
- Prevents overlapping appointments with **algorithm verification**.

### 🔹 **Ride-Sharing Apps**
- Uses **Formal Specifications** to define **driver-passenger matching logic**.
- Ensures **efficient and fair ride allocation**.

## ⚠️ Risks of Not Using Formal Methods
- **Hidden Bugs & Defects** – Leads to app crashes and unexpected behavior.
- **Algorithmic Bias** – Unchecked algorithms may cause unfair outcomes.
- **Higher Maintenance Costs** – Fixing post-release bugs is expensive.
- **Security Vulnerabilities** – Lack of rigorous verification can lead to data breaches.

## 🚧 Challenges & Limitations
- **Mathematical Complexity** – Requires deep understanding of formal logic.
- **Time-Consuming** – Writing formal specifications takes longer than traditional coding.
- **High Cost** – Specialized training and tools are expensive for small teams.
- **Scalability Issues** – Difficult to apply FM to rapidly changing large-scale projects.

## 🔮 Future of FM in Mobile Applications
- **AI-powered Theorem Provers** – Automate FM verification.
- **Machine Learning + FM** – Predict system failures and optimize verification speed.
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts** – Ensuring correctness in decentralized applications.
